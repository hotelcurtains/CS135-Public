let S(k,p) = k + (1/2)p(p+1)  		i.e. T(k,n) but k+n = p
let C(n) = p = k + n			p > k becuase p = k+n and n cannot be 0

T(k,n) = S(k, C(n))

prove C is injective
prove S is injective?
=> T is injective?
injective == one-to-one




assume p > p'     (=> p != p')  	WLOG
on contradiction, p must be = p'

k + (1/2)p(p+1) > k + (1/2)p'(p'+1)
(1/2)p(p+1) > (1/2)p'(p'+1)
p(p+1) > p'(p'+1)


???
p/p' > (p+1)/(p'+1)

p > p'(p'+1)/(p+1)

k=1, n=1;  n'=2
p=2, p'=3 \in Z+
2 > 3(3+1)/(2+1)
2 > 4 FALSE
